# CS 4230 - Project 3

## The WeCheatEm Bank

You get to write a program to manage a handful of bank loans.

### Requirements

1. **Customer Account**
   - A customer has an account number, generated by the system.
     - A customer has one savings account (at all times, even if it is empty).
     - A customer may have up to three loans at a time.

2. **Monthly Customer Actions**
   - Each month, a customer may do the following:
     - Initiate a loan
     - Make a payment on a loan
     - Deposit to savings
     - Withdraw from savings
     - A customer may do each of the above in a month, but it is up to you whether a customer may do items a-d multiple times in one month.

3. **Interest Rates**
   - You must set the interest rates for loans at startup. These are yearly interest rates.
     - All interest rates are in increments of 0.25%.
     - The loan interest rate must be between 6% and 18%, inclusive.
     - The savings rate is one-fourth of the loan rate.

4. **Advance Command**
   - One special command is something like “advance to the next month” or similar.

5. **Monthly Changes**
   - At the change of each month, do the following:
     - Calculate the interest on loans and savings accounts.
     - Add the interest into the accounts.
     - Generate a statement for each customer that shows beginning balances, account activity during the month, interest applied, and ending balances.

6. **Late Fees**
   - If the minimum is not paid, a $50 late fee is assessed (added to the loan balance).

7. **Minimum Payment**
   - The bill includes the minimum payment required. The minimum payment is the amount of interest due plus one percent of the principal, or $10, whichever is greater. Note that the bank is not particularly interested in helping you get out of debt; they are happy to have you pay on your loan nearly forever.
     - BUT if the loan is delinquent (the customer didn’t pay enough last month), add $50 to the minimum payment. (Note: if they miss two or more payments, the late fees keep getting added to the loan balance. But it’s always only $50 added to the minimum payment.)

8. **Loan Amount Limits**
   - The maximum amount of a loan at origination is $50,000. The minimum amount is $500.

9. **Loan Payments**
   - Loan payments above the minimum are accepted, but not above the balance.

10. **Loan Account Closure**
    - A loan account is automatically closed when the balance is paid.
      - Does that mean at the close of the month, or right away? You decide (and consider the ramifications of your decision).

### Notes
- Accounts never have fractions of cents. It’s up to you whether to round up, down, or nearest. (If I were the owner of WeCheat’em, I would always round in my favor, but you might find it easier to program in other ways…)
- It would be nice, but not required, to provide a way to read a (text) file of loans at startup, in order to make testing easier.
